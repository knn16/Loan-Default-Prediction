# Loan Default Prediction
This project is a part of the Data Science course in the Master of Quantitative Management: Business Analytics. Using a data set from Kaggle that can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn, we worked in a team of 5 to predict the churn probability of customers in a fictional telecom company.
